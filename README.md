Probability of get 7 from 1 roll is = 1/6 ,,, probability of get none 7 is 5/6 ,,, you have to do 3 rools , so you have a probability (5/6)^3 of getting none 7 ,,, so we need one 7 at least ,,, so we can complement the none 7 probability to get the probability of get one 7 at least by do .. 1 - (5/6)^3 = 0.42
